# Global Styles

Even though it's great to be able to connect styles to specific components,
sometimes it's helpful to apply some _global base styles_ to all elements
throughout our application.

We could do this by creating a separate CSS file, but then we'd lose out on the
other benefits of working with `styled-components`, like being able to customize
our CSS via props.

To solve this, `styled-components` gives a special `createGlobalStyle` function
that will let us create a component for handling global styles. Here's how it
looks:

```jsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  body {
    font-family: "Comic Sans MS", sans-serif;
    color: red;
  }

  a {
    text-decoration: none;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: blue;
  }
`;

// then at the root of the app
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <main>
        <nav>
          <a href="#home">Home</a>
          <a href="#about">About</a>
        </nav>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Exercise

There aren't any specific deliverables for this one, just play around with the
code in the exercise file and experiment! Try adding some additional rules to
the `createGlobalStyle` component, and see how they change the rest of the
application.
